#+TITLE:Change Detection Using Machine Learning
#+DESCRIPITION: Project details


* April 21, 2020
** Initial Questions
#+BEGIN_INFO
\bullet What is QI data and how can it help us?
\bull How will having mulitspectral images assist in change detection?
\bull Am I stupid for not knowing where the x8 comes from in 10980x10980x8?
#+END_INFO

** Done today
#+begin_info
\bull Created GitHub'\\'
\bull Created progress/prep document
\bull Finished intern orientation and necessary documents.
\bull Created acount with USGS and downloaded data
\bullet Read through some exampels of U-nets in colab
#+end_info
** Understanding The Data
*** Sentinal-2 data
#+BEGIN_INFO
\bull 650MB file size.
\bull One file for each 13 spectral bands plus metadata .jp2
\bull 10980x10980x8
\bull Use QI data to Georeference the data?
\bullet Maybe the GeoTIFF file could help.
#+END_INFO
** TODO
#+begin_note
\bullet Add Brain and Ryan as contributers
\bullet Hopefully switch over to confluence and get VDI set up.
\bull More research into what has been done regarding U-nets with complex images
