#+TITLE:Change Detection Using Machine Learning
#+DESCRIPITION: Project details


* Useful Links
** [[https://github.com/wenhwu/awesome-remote-sensing-change-detection][List of datasets, codes, papers and constests related to remote sensing change detection]]

* ML Methods to become familiar with
** TODO LSTM blocks

* April 21, 2020
** Initial Questions
#+BEGIN_INFO
\bullet What is QI data and how can it help us?

\bull How will having mulitspectral images assist in change detection?

\bull Am I stupid for not knowing where the x8 comes from in 10980x10980x8 that defines a certian .jp2 file?

#+END_INFO

** Done today
#+begin_info
\bull Created GitHub

\bull Created progress/prep document

\bull Finished intern orientation and necessary documents.

\bull Created an account with USGS and downloaded some data

\bullet Read through some examples of U-nets in colab
#+end_info
** Understanding The Data
*** Sentinal-2 data
#+BEGIN_INFO
\bull 650MB file size.

\bull One file for each of the 13 spectral bands plus metadata .jp2 filetype

\bull 10980x10980x8

\bull Use QI data to Georeference the data?

\bullet Maybe the GeoTIFF file could help.
#+END_INFO
** TODO
#+begin_note
\bullet Add Brain and Ryan as contributers

\bullet Hopefully start using confluence and get VDI set up.

\bull More research into what has been done regarding U-nets with complex images

\bull More research into Change Detection Dataset

\bull Get more of an idea as to what has already been done regarding this project

** Questions
#+begin_info
\bull CUDA issues
#+end_info
** Discussion
#+begin_info
\bull Found GitHub [[https://github.com/mpapadomanolaki/UNetLSTM][code]] that detects urban changes in sentinel-2 data (pytorch) (Uses GPU through CUDA platform)
